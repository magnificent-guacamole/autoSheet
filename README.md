# AutoSheet(TM)

## Description

AutoSheet(TM) is a powerful tool powered by AI and deep learning, that helps you complete your timesheets automatically.
Unleash the power of the 21st century by automating dumb repetitive things. This way, you can focus on what's actually important: coffee.

## How to use

Open a linux _(WSL will do the job, you poor windows user)_ terminal and just `make`
Oh, yeah should have said that before, but you need to `cp secrets.export.template secrets.export` and `vim secrets.export` to setup your accounts. Then you can `:wq` and `make`

## Configuration

No conf mate. Get over it and read the script, it's really not that complicated and if you ask your idiot bloke Copilot it'll tell you what to do anyways. So why would I bother.
__TODO:__ Add configuration options for the bogans here.

## Disclaimer

Use this script at your own risks. It's a deep learning / AI powered tool that grew a conscience, and tends to do whatever she wants. Be mindful of the stupidity of it too. It fed on the entire internet, so she absorbed a looot of really stupid conversations from shady forums and Telegram messages...
